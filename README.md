The VISA experience is a value-added-service for Visa card holders. This app gives the user a one-stop solution to avail a variety of services such as restaurant booking, movie tickets, golf courses and much more. A very convenient and seemless way to:
1. Make reservations
2. Keep track of pending reservations
3. Avail offers
4. Book cab to and from the service location
5. Pay service provider

It is aimed at offering an end-to-end solution for the user. This hackathon demo only takes care of the usecase of making reservations at restaurants.
