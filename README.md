# VISA experience app
## Hackathon submission by team '6 Rooks'

The VISA experience app gives the user a one-stop solution for booking of restaurants, movie tickets and golf courses. It helps the user keep track of pending reservations, book a cab to the desired location, and
also pay the invoice for the resrvation, making it an end-to-end solution for the user. This hackathon demo only takes care of the usecase of making a reservation at a restaurant.
